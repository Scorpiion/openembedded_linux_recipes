Subject: [PATCH 24/24] ARM: ep93xx: Fix inverted RTS and DTR signals
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

It was discovered by Roberto Bergo, that RTS/DTR signals are inverted after
the boot, because it was causing him problems with hardware controlled modem
connected on ttyAM0. Todd Valentic came with this patch for the issue.
